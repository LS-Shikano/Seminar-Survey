# Seminar-Survey
Skeleton Project for Seminar Survey in Otree. PLEASE do not push to the repo on the main branch, just clone it and create a branch for your group if you push. 

- StartApp and EndApp are shared by all groups and contain the demographic questions for everybody, as well as setting the frame for participants
- Each group has their own app for their module, note that models.py and pages.py still have to be created, please try to contain your module in a single app, otherwise there might be problems later on
  - Rember to change the settings.py file if you want to check your app!

Once we are all done, we will merge the versions and make sure it is all compatible and working
